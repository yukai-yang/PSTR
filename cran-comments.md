This is an updated version of the existing package "PSTR" on CRAN.
The corresponding paper has no doi as it is a working paper.
I mentioned and offered the link of the corresponding paper in the manual of the package.
That is, the user can find the paper when they run "?PSTR".
This package has been mentioned explicitly in the paper,
which means that most of the users find the package after they have read the paper.

## Updates and new features

* fix the errors in R version 4.
* change documentation.

## R CMD check results

0 ERRORs | 0 WARNINGs | 0 NOTES.

## Downstream dependencies

* I did not test all dependencies, but do not think any of the changes should effect them.
